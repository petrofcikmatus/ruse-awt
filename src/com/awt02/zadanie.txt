You have to prepare/compile an Application in Java, having the following functionality:

- Allows placing points, using the mouse (left click; the point is a circle with radius 5 pixels).
The items/points should be able to place only if the small circle (the point) is contained entirely
in one of four quadrants. In each quadrant the point is drawn with a different color (one color for the quadrant);

- Two text fields follow the coordinates of the mouse at any time;
